    name -> module-path map for a split module). Nothing is imported until a name is used, so importing
    the old path costs nothing; each use warns at the caller's line. Patching a name on the old module
    does not reach the package: patch the new path.

    ``stacklevel`` counts the frames between the access and this closure's ``warnings.warn``, and it is
    what makes the warning *visible*: CPython's default filters are ``default::DeprecationWarning:__main__``
    followed by ``ignore::DeprecationWarning``, and the module they match on is the one the reported frame
    belongs to. The default 2 is right when the closure is bound straight to ``__getattr__``. A shim that
    needs logic of its own -- a package-as-shim exempting its real submodules, or an entry-point target
    forwarded silently -- calls the closure from *its* ``__getattr__``, one frame further in, and must pass
    ``stacklevel=3``; otherwise every warning is attributed to the shim module itself, ``ignore`` swallows
    it, and the deprecation is announced to nobody.
