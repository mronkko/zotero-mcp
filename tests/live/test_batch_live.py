"""Live tests for the Batch API path, behind a gate of their own.

These are separated from the rest of tests/live/ by a second environment
variable, ``ZOTERO_MCP_LIVE_BATCH=1``, because they are not like the other
live tests. A batch job is asynchronous: this submits real work to the
provider and then *waits* for it, which took roughly three minutes against
Gemini on the run that validated this file and carries no upper bound the
provider guarantees. Folding that into the ordinary live suite would make a
quick check into a coffee break, so it is opt-in twice:

    ZOTERO_MCP_LIVE_TESTS=1 ZOTERO_MCP_LIVE_BATCH=1 \\
        uv run pytest tests/live/test_batch_live.py -v

The provider is whichever one ``~/.config/zotero-mcp/config.json`` names, via
the same config-match gate the rest of the live suite uses, so this exercises
a real configuration rather than a synthetic one.

What is worth proving live, and cannot be proved otherwise:

**Batch vectors must land in the same embedding space as realtime ones.**
Nothing enforces this. The batch path builds raw JSONL request bodies by
hand while the realtime path goes through the provider SDK, so the two can
drift apart in ways that still produce perfectly valid-looking vectors — and
a collection holding both would then return quietly wrong neighbours forever.
Gemini makes this sharp: v2 models take the task instruction as a prompt
prefix and v1 models take a ``task_type`` field, and the field is spelled
``retrieval_document`` through the SDK but ``RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT`` in raw
REST, because the SDK normalizes the enum and raw JSON does not. That
asymmetry looks like a bug and is not, which is exactly the kind of thing
that gets "fixed" into a real bug later. This test is the guard.

Measured on the validating run (gemini-embedding-001, 3072 dims): cosine
0.999999, 0.999999, 1.000000 against realtime, with zero failed rows.
