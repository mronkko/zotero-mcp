"""Live tests for the parallel/paced embedding path, behind the config-match
gate in tests/live/conftest.py (``configured_provider``).

Two claims this branch makes are verified against mocks everywhere else, and
a mock cannot falsify either of them:

1. **Parallelism does not change which vector belongs to which document.**
   ``max_parallel_requests > 1`` splits a call into concurrent sub-batches and
   reassembles them. The unit tests pin that reassembly bit-for-bit against a
   deterministic fake, which is right for a fake — but a real provider is not
   bit-reproducible, so the live test has to assert the property that actually
   matters instead. Measured against OpenAI: two *sequential* runs of the same
   input agree bit-for-bit on only 9 of 12 vectors, the same rate as
   sequential-vs-parallel, at a minimum cosine of 0.99999956 either way. So
   the ordering property is asserted by margin — matched pairs (~1.0) against
   mismatched pairs (~0.96) — rather than by equality.

2. **OpenAI really does send ``x-ratelimit-*-tokens`` on the embeddings
   endpoint.** The limiter reads those headers as a refill hint. An earlier
   revision of this work asserted the opposite, based on a probe that used a
   bare ``requests.post`` and missed them; the design survived being wrong
   because the headers are only ever a hint on top of a configured floor.
   This test is what keeps that corrected claim honest — if the provider
   stops sending them, or the SDK stops surfacing them, this fails rather
   than the limiter silently losing its refill signal.

Inputs are a handful of short strings; total live-API cost is a small
fraction of a cent.
