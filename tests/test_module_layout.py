"""Guard test for the module-layout move series.

Each PR in the structural refactor moves one or more modules to a new
dotted path and leaves a lazy PEP 562 forwarder (``_shim.forwarder``) at
the old path, so external callers keep working with a deprecation warning.
Internally, though, nothing should still use the old path: a shim
*resolves* attribute access, so a stale
``monkeypatch.setattr("zotero_mcp.utils.is_local_mode", ...)`` would keep
succeeding even after ``is_local_mode`` moved away — it would just patch an
attribute nothing calls anymore, and the test would go on "passing" while
testing nothing. The same is true of a stray ``import zotero_mcp.utils``
left over from before a move.

This file scans the tree for exactly that: any quoted ``"zotero_mcp...."``
string or ``from``/``import`` statement whose dotted path is a shim's old
path (or a deeper attribute reached through it). It fails loudly, listing
every hit as ``file:line: old -> use new``, so a move PR can't leave a
stale reference behind. It does not scan itself -- see ``_test_files``.
