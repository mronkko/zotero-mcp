"""Tests for ``zotero_mcp._shim.forwarder``, the lazy PEP 562 helper every
move PR in the structural refactor uses to keep a deprecated module path
importable. See ``src/zotero_mcp/_shim.py`` and ``docs/architecture.md``,
"Shims".

Each test builds real, importable modules under ``tmp_path`` (rather than
faking attribute access), because the behaviour under test -- warnings
pointing at the caller's line, and the target genuinely not being imported
until a name is used -- only shows up with real module objects and a real
``sys.path``/``sys.modules``. Every test cleans up the module names it
registers in ``sys.modules`` so test order cannot matter.
